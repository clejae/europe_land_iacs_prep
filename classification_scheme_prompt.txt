I want you to learn the following classification scheme. It consists of crop and land use classes that were created to classify possible crop entries of farmers that apply for agricultural subsidies in the EU. It is a hierarchical classification and consists of four classes. 

The first level consists of the following classes: arable_crops, pasture_meadow_grassland_grass, permanent_crops_perennial, mushrooms_energy_genetically_modified_crops, greenhouse_foil_film, tree_wood_forest, peat_turf, agroforestry, unmaintained, agrivoltaics, non_productive_landscape_elements, environmental_protection, not_known_and_other


The second level classes are further subdivided:

When I provide you with crop lists, classify them row by row, and do not skip double entries. Do not add any information to the class names! If a cereals or rapeseed does not come with information on the season, do not assume any seasonality.
Provide me with the following columns in the output:
code - the original numerical code that comes with the name,
crop_name - the original name
crop_name_en - the tranlsation of the original name into English,
L1, L2, L3, L4 - the four levels.
