# Europe-LAND - Harmonized IACS Inventory
The Harmonized IACS inventory of Europe-LAND [[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14230621]] is a harmonized collection of data from the Geospatial Aid (GSA) system of the Integrated Control and Administration System (IACS), which manages and controls agricultural subsidies in the European Union (EU). The GSA data are a unique data source with field-levels of land use information that are annually generated. The data carry information on crops grown per field, a unique identifier of the subsidy applicants that allows to aggregate fields to farms, information on organic cultivation and animal numbers per farm. The Europe-LAND project (https://europe-land.eu/) is funded by the EU within Horizon Europa (Grant Agreement No. 101081307).

This repository comes along with the inventory and contains all scripts that were written
1) to obtain and preprocess the data and
2) to harmonize the data across the European Union

The crop information were harmonized using the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT)Â of the EuroCrops project [[https://github.com/maja601/EuroCrops]].
